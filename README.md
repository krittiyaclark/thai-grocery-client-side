# Thai grocery API - Client-Side

## Tech Stack: Next.js, Tailwind, and TypeScript

This client-side application, which is an ongoing project, uses Next.js to fetch
the [Thai grocery API](https://github.com/krittiyaclark/thai-grocery-api) which
allows the user to search for Thai groceries in the app.

Clone project

git clone https://github.com/krittiyaclark/thai-grocery-client-side.git
```

First, run the development server:

```
yarn
```

and

```
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the
result.
